### RAW Pipeline (2 nodes)

| Node | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **RAW Load** | Decodes camera RAW files (.cr3, .nef, .arw, .raf, .dng, .rw2, .orf, .pef, .x3f, .iiq, and more) via rawpy/LibRaw. Exposes demosaic algorithm, white balance, highlight mode, output colorspace, linear-scene vs sRGB-display output, and a **Camera Look** profile selector (see below). Outputs an IMAGE and a `RAW_METADATA` sidecar. |
| **RAW Metadata Split** | Splits `RAW_METADATA` into 15 typed primitives: camera make/model, lens make/model, ISO, aperture, shutter, focal length, datetime, sensor type, resolution, Fuji film sim, and more. Wire any primitive directly into a text node or downstream tool. |

#### Camera Look Profiles — `ComfyUI/models/camera_profiles/`

RAW Load can apply Adobe `.dcp` profiles — per-body color calibration (`Adobe Standard`) or creative looks (`Camera Standard`, `Camera Landscape`, Fuji film sims, etc.). The `camera_look` dropdown on the node is a union of every `.dcp` found across these locations, in priority order:

1. **`ComfyUI/models/camera_profiles/<Make Model>/`** — drop user-installed packs here. Respects `extra_model_paths.yaml`. Example: `ComfyUI/models/camera_profiles/Fujifilm X-T5/Fujifilm X-T5 Camera VELVIA.dcp`.
2. **`ComfyUI-Darkroom/data/dcp_looks/`** — reserved for profiles bundled with the pack.
3. **Adobe install paths** (auto-discovered if Camera Raw / Lightroom is installed on the same machine): `C:/ProgramData/Adobe/CameraRaw/CameraProfiles/Camera/` and the Lightroom Classic resources equivalent.

**What ships with Adobe:** Camera Look profiles for Canon, Nikon, Sony, Panasonic, Olympus, Pentax, and others (Camera Standard / Landscape / Portrait / Faithful / Neutral / Monochrome, etc.). If you have Camera Raw or Lightroom installed, these work with zero setup.

**Fujifilm users:** Adobe does not ship Fuji Camera Look profiles as .dcp files (Fuji's in-camera film sims are baked into the Camera Raw engine binary, not exposed on disk). To get Velvia / Provia / Astia / Classic Chrome / Eterna / Pro Neg Hi / Pro Neg Std / Reala Ace as DCPs, build them yourself from [abpy/FujifilmCameraProfiles](https://github.com/abpy/FujifilmCameraProfiles) (CC-BY-NC-SA 4.0):

```bash
# One-time: clone the abpy LookTable + ToneCurve source
git clone https://github.com/abpy/FujifilmCameraProfiles third_party/FujifilmCameraProfiles

# Build 8 sim DCPs for your body (requires the body's Adobe Standard DCP
# installed at C:/ProgramData/Adobe/CameraRaw/CameraProfiles/Adobe Standard/)
python tools/build_fuji_dcps.py \
  --body "Fujifilm X-T5" \
  --abpy third_party/FujifilmCameraProfiles \
  --out  "ComfyUI/models/camera_profiles/Fujifilm X-T5"
```

The `tools/build_fuji_dcps.py` script splices abpy's per-sim LookTable + ToneCurve onto your body's Adobe Standard base matrices and writes 8 DCPs (Provia / Velvia / Astia / Classic Chrome / Pro Neg Hi / Pro Neg Std / Eterna / Reala Ace) that drop directly into the `camera_look` dropdown. Repeat for each body you shoot with. Classic Neg / Nostalgic Neg / Bleach Bypass ship as `.cube` LUTs only in abpy and can be used via the LUT Apply node.

If the selected Camera Look isn't available for the detected body, the node silently falls back to Adobe Standard and logs a console warning.

### Pipeline — LUT & Color Management (7 nodes)

| Node | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **LUT Identity Generator** | Outputs a neutral identity lattice image. Feed into LUT Bake Inject to grade your photo and bake a .cube at the same time. Sizes: 17, 33, 65. |
| **LUT Bake Inject** | Pairs your photo with the identity lattice as a 2-image batch. The grading chain then processes both with identical settings — no node duplication. |
| **LUT Bake Extract** | Splits the batch back out after the grading chain: graded photo to preview, graded lattice to LUT Export. |
| **LUT Export (.cube)** | Bakes any Darkroom processing chain into a standard .cube 3D LUT file. Works in DaVinci Resolve, Premiere Pro, Photoshop, Capture One, FCPX — any tool that supports 3D LUTs. |
| **LUT Apply (.cube)** | Loads and applies any .cube 3D LUT with trilinear interpolation. Import looks from DaVinci Resolve, download creative LUTs, or reuse exported Darkroom grades. Strength slider for blending. |
| **Color Space Transform** | Convert between sRGB, Linear sRGB, ACEScg, ACEScct, Rec.2020, and DCI-P3. The only ACES-aware color management in ComfyUI. Soft gamut compression option. |
| **ACES Tonemap** | Industry-standard tonemapping: ACES Filmic, ACES Fitted (Hill), AgX (Blender), Reinhard, Filmic (Uncharted 2). Exposure bias, ACES gamut conversion, white point control. |

## LUT Bake Workflow — grade your photo and export a .cube in one pass

Building a LUT in Darkroom used to mean running the grading chain twice — once on your photo, once on an identity lattice — with settings duplicated across two parallel chains. That's tedious and error-prone. The **LUT Bake Inject / Extract** pair fixes that: one chain, one set of settings, your photo and the LUT come out the other side together.

**How it works:** Inject pads your photo and the identity lattice to a shared canvas and stacks them as a 2-image batch. Every Darkroom color node iterates the batch dimension and applies the exact same transform to both images. After the chain, Extract splits the batch back into the graded photo and the processed lattice — the lattice goes to LUT Export.

**Wiring:**

```
Load Image ──► photo ─────┐
                          ├─► LUT Bake Inject ─► [grading chain] ─► LUT Bake Extract ─► graded_photo  ──► Preview
LUT Identity ─► lattice ──┤                                                        ├─► graded_lattice ─► LUT Export
                          └─► lut_size ─────────────────────────────────────────── └─► lut_size       ─┘
```

- Connect **LUT Identity Generator → identity_lattice** input of **LUT Bake Inject**.
- Connect your **Load Image → photo** input of **LUT Bake Inject**.
- Run any **color-only** Darkroom nodes between Inject and Extract — Tone Curve, Lift Gamma Gain, HSL Selective, Film Stock, Hue vs X, Color Warper, etc.
- **LUT Bake Extract** gives you three outputs: `graded_photo` (to Preview / Save Image), `graded_lattice` (to LUT Export's `processed_lattice`), and `lut_size` (to LUT Export's `lut_size`).

### Color-only rule — what can go in the chain

A 3D LUT is a per-pixel color lookup. It has no idea about neighboring pixels. So only nodes that transform each pixel independently can be baked:

**Allowed in the bake chain:**
Film Stock (Color), Film Stock (B&W), Print Stock, Cross Process, White Balance, Exposure & Tone, HSL Selective, Vibrance, Tone Curve, Lift Gamma Gain, Log Wheels, 3-Way Color Balance, Hue vs Hue, Hue vs Sat, Lum vs Sat, Sat vs Sat, Color Warper, Color Space Transform, ACES Tonemap, LUT Apply.

**NOT allowed in the bake chain** (they use pixel neighborhoods and will corrupt the lattice):
Film Grain, Halation, Clarity / Texture / Dehaze, Sharpening Pro, Noise Reduction, Skin Tone Uniformity, Color Qualifier (partial — uses local masks), Chromatic Aberration, Vignette, Lens Distortion, Perspective Correct, Lens Profile.

If you want spatial effects on your final image, apply them to `graded_photo` **after** Extract, not inside the bake chain.

### Example workflow

A ready-to-use example is in [`workflows/lut_bake_and_apply.json`](workflows/lut_bake_and_apply.json). Drag it into ComfyUI, load a photo, and press Queue Prompt — you'll get a graded preview and a `.cube` file in `output/luts/`.

## Installation

```bash
cd ComfyUI/custom_nodes/
git clone https://github.com/jeremieLouvaert/ComfyUI-Darkroom.git
pip install -r ComfyUI-Darkroom/requirements.txt
```

Restart ComfyUI. All 38 nodes appear under **AKURATE/Darkroom/** with subcategories: Film, Raw, Grading, Lens, Pipeline, RAW.

### Dependencies

- **scipy** (>= 1.10.0) — spline interpolation, Gaussian filters, FFT convolution
- **opensimplex** (>= 0.4) — high-quality simplex noise for film grain

No API keys. No GPU required. Pure numpy/scipy computation.

## Architecture

All processing happens in **linear light** (sRGB gamma removed before processing, reapplied after). Every node supports:

- **Strength slider** (0-1) — non-destructive blending with original
- **Batch processing** — handles ComfyUI's multi-image batches
- **Preset + override** — presets provide instant results, sliders fine-tune

Film stock data sourced from Capture One Film Styles (586 .costyle files parsed) and published Kodak/Fuji/Ilford technical data sheets. Lens profiles measured from real optical characteristics.
