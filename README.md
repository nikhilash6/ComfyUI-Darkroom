### RAW Pipeline (2 nodes)

| Node | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **RAW Load** | Decodes camera RAW files (.cr3, .nef, .arw, .raf, .dng, .rw2, .orf, .pef, .x3f, .iiq, and more) via rawpy/LibRaw. Exposes demosaic algorithm, white balance, highlight mode, output colorspace, linear-scene vs sRGB-display output, and a **Camera Look** profile selector (see below). Outputs an IMAGE and a `RAW_METADATA` sidecar. |
| **RAW Metadata Split** | Splits `RAW_METADATA` into 15 typed primitives: camera make/model, lens make/model, ISO, aperture, shutter, focal length, datetime, sensor type, resolution, Fuji film sim, and more. Wire any primitive directly into a text node or downstream tool. |

#### Camera Look Profiles — `ComfyUI/models/camera_profiles/`

RAW Load can apply Adobe `.dcp` profiles — per-body color calibration (`Adobe Standard`) or creative looks (`Camera Standard`, `Camera Landscape`, Fuji film sims, etc.). The `camera_look` dropdown on the node is a union of every `.dcp` found across these locations, in priority order:

1. **`ComfyUI/models/camera_profiles/<Make Model>/`** — drop user-installed packs here. Respects `extra_model_paths.yaml`. Example: `ComfyUI/models/camera_profiles/Fujifilm X-T5/Fujifilm X-T5 Camera VELVIA.dcp`.
2. **`ComfyUI-Darkroom/data/dcp_looks/`** — reserved for profiles bundled with the pack.
3. **Adobe install paths** (auto-discovered if Camera Raw / Lightroom is installed on the same machine): `C:/ProgramData/Adobe/CameraRaw/CameraProfiles/Camera/` and the Lightroom Classic resources equivalent.

**What ships with Adobe:** Camera Look profiles for Canon, Nikon, Sony, Panasonic, Olympus, Pentax, and others (Camera Standard / Landscape / Portrait / Faithful / Neutral / Monochrome, etc.). If you have Camera Raw or Lightroom installed, these work with zero setup.

**Fujifilm users:** Adobe does not ship Fuji Camera Look profiles as .dcp files (Fuji's in-camera film sims are baked into the Camera Raw engine binary, not exposed on disk). To get Velvia / Provia / Astia / Classic Chrome / Eterna / Pro Neg Hi / Pro Neg Std / Reala Ace as DCPs, build them yourself from [abpy/FujifilmCameraProfiles](https://github.com/abpy/FujifilmCameraProfiles) (CC-BY-NC-SA 4.0):

```bash
# One-time: clone the abpy LookTable + ToneCurve source
git clone https://github.com/abpy/FujifilmCameraProfiles third_party/FujifilmCameraProfiles

# Build 8 sim DCPs for your body (requires the body's Adobe Standard DCP
# installed at C:/ProgramData/Adobe/CameraRaw/CameraProfiles/Adobe Standard/)
python tools/build_fuji_dcps.py \
  --body "Fujifilm X-T5" \
  --abpy third_party/FujifilmCameraProfiles \
  --out  "ComfyUI/models/camera_profiles/Fujifilm X-T5"
```

The `tools/build_fuji_dcps.py` script splices abpy's per-sim LookTable + ToneCurve onto your body's Adobe Standard base matrices and writes 8 DCPs (Provia / Velvia / Astia / Classic Chrome / Pro Neg Hi / Pro Neg Std / Eterna / Reala Ace) that drop directly into the `camera_look` dropdown. Repeat for each body you shoot with. Classic Neg / Nostalgic Neg / Bleach Bypass ship as `.cube` LUTs only in abpy and can be used via the LUT Apply node.

**B&W sims (Acros / Monochrome + R/Y/G filter variants):** abpy deliberately skips Fuji's black-and-white simulations because Fuji's B&W rendering is a channel-mix plus tone curve that DCP's HSV-based LookTable expresses awkwardly, so there's no public pack. Darkroom ships a separate builder, `tools/build_fuji_bw_dcps.py`, that synthesizes the B&W look tables from published Neopan 100 Acros channel weights (for Acros) and BT.709 luma (for Monochrome), with Wratten 8 / 11 / 25 filter transmissions pre-multiplied for the +Y / +G / +R variants. This is Darkroom's approximation, not a calibrated 1:1 match to Fuji's in-camera output. Usage mirrors the color builder:

```bash
python tools/build_fuji_bw_dcps.py \
  --body "Fujifilm X-T5" \
  --out  "ComfyUI/models/camera_profiles/Fujifilm X-T5"
```

Writes 8 DCPs per body: Acros, Acros+R, Acros+Y, Acros+G, Monochrome, Monochrome+R, Monochrome+Y, Monochrome+G. Runs without the abpy checkout (the B&W tables are synthesized, not spliced).

If the selected Camera Look isn't available for the detected body, the node silently falls back to Adobe Standard and logs a console warning.

### Spectral Film Stock (1 node, 35 presets)

| Node | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Spectral Film Stock** | Pre-baked `.cube` LUTs derived from full negative→print spectral simulation. Each preset encodes scene-light → spectral sensitivity → log exposure → H&D density → dye spectral density → printer light → print density → sRGB. Shipped presets cover C41 still (Portra 160/400/800, Ektar 100, Gold 200, Ultramax, Fuji Pro 160C/160S/400H, Superia Reala / X-Tra 400, Natura 1600, Vericolor III on Endura / Supra / Portra Endura / Fuji Crystal Archive papers), Cinema (Vision3 50D/200T/250D/500T on 2383 / 2393), Reversal slides (Velvia 50, Provia 100F, Ektachrome 100D, Kodachrome 64 on Ilfochrome / Ektachrome Radiance III), Instant (FP-100C, Instax Color on Fujiflex), Niche (Aerocolor, Aerocolor High, Agfa Vista 100), B&W (Tri-X 400, Kodak 5222 on Polymax grades). |

The baker is vendored at `third_party/spectral_film_lut/` (MIT, JanLohse/spectral_film_lut), stripped to the headless engine. Run `python tools/bake_spectral_luts.py --all` to regenerate or extend; bake takes ~13 s for all 35 LUTs. See `tools/bake_spectral_luts.py` for the preset registry — add your own `_cat(...)` entries for extra neg×print combos and rebake.

### Scopes (2 nodes)

| Node | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Histogram** | Per-channel R/G/B / Luma / single-channel histogram with 0/25/50/75/100% graticule and clip-warning stripes on the edges. Log-scale toggle for highlight-dominant images. Output is IMAGE — wire to PreviewImage. |
| **Vectorscope** | Rec.709 YCbCr density plot with 75% + 100% saturation rings, six primary target boxes (R/Yl/G/Cy/B/Mg), the 123° skin-tone line (I-line), configurable gain (zoom into low-sat scenes) and log-scale density. Cold-to-warm heatmap. |

### Reference-driven Color Match (1 node)

| Node | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Color Match (Reference)** | Grade a target image toward a reference's colour distribution. Four LAB-space methods in one dropdown: **reinhard** (mean/std transfer, fast safe default), **wasserstein** (sliced optimal transport via iterative advection, handles multi-modal distributions), **forgy** (K-means palette matching with Gaussian-weighted soft assignment, sklearn), **kantorovich** (closed-form Gaussian linear transport, requires `pip install POT`). Intensity blend + per-method tuning (n_colors, n_slices, sample_size, seed). Algorithms adapted from [rajawski/gradia](https://github.com/rajawski/gradia) (MIT). |

### CMYK Print Workflow (4 nodes)

| Node | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **CMYK Soft-Proof** | RGB → target CMYK → RGB roundtrip preview. Image stays in RGB for continued editing, the colour shift you see is what will happen on press. |
| **CMYK Gamut Warning** | Overlays pixels that cannot be accurately reproduced by the chosen print condition (threshold configurable). Logs out-of-gamut percentage. |
| **CMYK TAC Check** | Converts to CMYK and flags pixels where C+M+Y+K exceeds the TAC (Total Area Coverage) limit. Presets: 330% coated / 300% uncoated / 300% web coated / 240% newsprint / custom. Prevents ink-drying and show-through problems before the file ships. |
| **CMYK Export TIFF** | Writes a 4-channel CMYK TIFF with ICC profile embedded. LZW-compressed, configurable DPI, defaults to `ComfyUI/output/cmyk/`. This is the file you send to the printer. |

**ICC profile discovery:** The CMYK nodes auto-discover profiles from (1) `ComfyUI-Darkroom/data/icc_profiles/` for user drops, and (2) the OS colour-profile store. On Windows you already have FOGRA39 (ISO Coated v2), FOGRA27, FOGRA29 (uncoated), GRACoL 2006, US Web Coated SWOP v2, SWOP 2006 Grade 3/5, Euroscale Coated/Uncoated, SNAP 2007 newsprint, JapanColor 2001/2002 — all bundled by Windows at `C:\Windows\System32\spool\drivers\color\`. Additional free profiles are available from [ECI](https://www.eci.org/doku.php?id=en:downloads) (FOGRA51 / PSO Coated v3 / PSO Uncoated v3 / ISO Newspaper 26v4).

**Rendering intents:** perceptual for photos (default), relative colorimetric for logos and corporate, saturation for charts, absolute colorimetric for pre-press proofing simulation.

### Pipeline — LUT & Color Management (7 nodes)

| Node | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **LUT Identity Generator** | Outputs a neutral identity lattice image. Feed into LUT Bake Inject to grade your photo and bake a .cube at the same time. Sizes: 17, 33, 65. |
| **LUT Bake Inject** | Pairs your photo with the identity lattice as a 2-image batch. The grading chain then processes both with identical settings — no node duplication. |
| **LUT Bake Extract** | Splits the batch back out after the grading chain: graded photo to preview, graded lattice to LUT Export. |
| **LUT Export (.cube)** | Bakes any Darkroom processing chain into a standard .cube 3D LUT file. Works in DaVinci Resolve, Premiere Pro, Photoshop, Capture One, FCPX — any tool that supports 3D LUTs. |
| **LUT Apply (.cube)** | Loads and applies any .cube 3D LUT with trilinear interpolation. Import looks from DaVinci Resolve, download creative LUTs, or reuse exported Darkroom grades. Strength slider for blending. |
| **Color Space Transform** | Convert between sRGB, Linear sRGB, ACEScg, ACEScct, Rec.2020, and DCI-P3. The only ACES-aware color management in ComfyUI. Soft gamut compression option. |
| **ACES Tonemap** | Industry-standard tonemapping: ACES Filmic, ACES Fitted (Hill), AgX (Blender), Reinhard, Filmic (Uncharted 2). Exposure bias, ACES gamut conversion, white point control. |

## LUT Bake Workflow — grade your photo and export a .cube in one pass

Building a LUT in Darkroom used to mean running the grading chain twice — once on your photo, once on an identity lattice — with settings duplicated across two parallel chains. That's tedious and error-prone. The **LUT Bake Inject / Extract** pair fixes that: one chain, one set of settings, your photo and the LUT come out the other side together.

**How it works:** Inject pads your photo and the identity lattice to a shared canvas and stacks them as a 2-image batch. Every Darkroom color node iterates the batch dimension and applies the exact same transform to both images. After the chain, Extract splits the batch back into the graded photo and the processed lattice — the lattice goes to LUT Export.

**Wiring:**

```
Load Image ──► photo ─────┐
                          ├─► LUT Bake Inject ─► [grading chain] ─► LUT Bake Extract ─► graded_photo  ──► Preview
LUT Identity ─► lattice ──┤                                                        ├─► graded_lattice ─► LUT Export
                          └─► lut_size ─────────────────────────────────────────── └─► lut_size       ─┘
```

- Connect **LUT Identity Generator → identity_lattice** input of **LUT Bake Inject**.
- Connect your **Load Image → photo** input of **LUT Bake Inject**.
- Run any **color-only** Darkroom nodes between Inject and Extract — Tone Curve, Lift Gamma Gain, HSL Selective, Film Stock, Hue vs X, Color Warper, etc.
- **LUT Bake Extract** gives you three outputs: `graded_photo` (to Preview / Save Image), `graded_lattice` (to LUT Export's `processed_lattice`), and `lut_size` (to LUT Export's `lut_size`).

### Color-only rule — what can go in the chain

A 3D LUT is a per-pixel color lookup. It has no idea about neighboring pixels. So only nodes that transform each pixel independently can be baked:

**Allowed in the bake chain:**
Film Stock (Color), Film Stock (B&W), Print Stock, Cross Process, White Balance, Exposure & Tone, HSL Selective, Vibrance, Tone Curve, Lift Gamma Gain, Log Wheels, 3-Way Color Balance, Hue vs Hue, Hue vs Sat, Lum vs Sat, Sat vs Sat, Color Warper, Color Space Transform, ACES Tonemap, LUT Apply.

**NOT allowed in the bake chain** (they use pixel neighborhoods and will corrupt the lattice):
Film Grain, Halation, Clarity / Texture / Dehaze, Sharpening Pro, Noise Reduction, Skin Tone Uniformity, Color Qualifier (partial — uses local masks), Chromatic Aberration, Vignette, Lens Distortion, Perspective Correct, Lens Profile.

If you want spatial effects on your final image, apply them to `graded_photo` **after** Extract, not inside the bake chain.

### Example workflow

A ready-to-use example is in [`workflows/lut_bake_and_apply.json`](workflows/lut_bake_and_apply.json). Drag it into ComfyUI, load a photo, and press Queue Prompt — you'll get a graded preview and a `.cube` file in `output/luts/`.

## Installation

```bash
cd ComfyUI/custom_nodes/
git clone https://github.com/jeremieLouvaert/ComfyUI-Darkroom.git
pip install -r ComfyUI-Darkroom/requirements.txt
```

Restart ComfyUI. All 46 nodes appear under **AKURATE/Darkroom/** with subcategories: Film (incl. Spectral), Raw, Grading (incl. Color Match), Lens, Pipeline, RAW, Scopes, Print.

### Dependencies

- **scipy** (>= 1.10.0) — spline interpolation, Gaussian filters, FFT convolution
- **opensimplex** (>= 0.4) — high-quality simplex noise for film grain

Optional:
- **POT** (`pip install POT`) — enables the Kantorovich method on Color Match. Reinhard / Wasserstein / Forgy all work without it.
- **colour-science** + **numba** — only required to *regenerate* Spectral Film Stock LUTs via `tools/bake_spectral_luts.py`. Consumers who install via Comfy Registry or git clone receive the pre-baked LUTs and never run the baker.

No API keys. No GPU required. Pure numpy/scipy computation (Histogram + Vectorscope render via PIL, CMYK nodes use PIL.ImageCms / LittleCMS).

## Architecture

All processing happens in **linear light** (sRGB gamma removed before processing, reapplied after). Every node supports:

- **Strength slider** (0-1) — non-destructive blending with original
- **Batch processing** — handles ComfyUI's multi-image batches
- **Preset + override** — presets provide instant results, sliders fine-tune

Film stock data sourced from Capture One Film Styles (586 .costyle files parsed) and published Kodak/Fuji/Ilford technical data sheets. Lens profiles measured from real optical characteristics.
